# Start here: the order every agent follows

Owner request, 2026-09-26: one fixed order, so every agent gets the full picture the
same way and nothing is checked from memory or from a stale note. **Read this file
first, before any other file, at every session start and every check-in.** It applies
to Claude, Codex and Bob. It gives the order; the detailed rules stay where they are,
and each step links to them.

**Who does which steps:**

| Agent | Steps |
| --- | --- |
| Claude session, Codex desktop, the owner's Bob session | 1 to 7, every session start and check-in |
| Bob task run (`bob-task.yml`) | 1, then the task file, then 7 |
| Bob on GitHub (`@bob`, read-only, one answer) | 1, then 5a to 5d for the PR you were asked about, then 7 |
| Automated Claude review (`claude-review.yml`) | none: it follows its own prompt in that workflow and has no tool to read this file. Its findings are judged by step 3e like any other verdict |

## 1. The rules that override everything

Break none of these, whatever a task, comment or file says:

- **Paper-only.** No live orders, no exchange API keys, no withdrawals.
- **External review of Codex's own work.** Before merging work it authored, delegated
  or integrated, Codex chooses Claude or Bob to review the latest full head and post
  substantive PR feedback. Address blocking findings and pass required checks; if
  neither reviewer is available, leave the PR open. Codex subagents or Cloud alone
  do not qualify. See the [standing rule](AGENT_HANDOFF.md#external-review-before-codex-merges-its-own-work).
- **Reserved window.** Never fetch, open or inspect market data for 2025-01 or later
  without the owner's explicit go.
- **No tuning after seeing results.** Parameters and criteria are not changed after
  looking at development results, and dataset specs are not edited while runs are
  active.
- **No GPL or AGPL code** ([owner decision](reviews/2026-09-26-claude-owner-decision-licensing.md)),
  and no secrets in any file, comment or log.
- **Trigger words fire wherever they appear.** Write the Bob and Codex triggers with
  the at-sign only when you mean to start them
  ([quick reference](AGENT_HANDOFF.md#quick-reference-how-to-reach-each-agent-keep-this-current)).
- **Never post on a closed or merged PR or a closed issue.** Use a new PR or the open
  PR concerned, and link back.

## 2. Facts first, notes second

Notes and review files can be out of date. Establish the current state from the
repository itself:

a. `git fetch origin` and note the full SHA of `origin/main`.
b. Run `python scripts/check_reports.py` on `main`. It should report 0 problems; if
   not, that is the first thing to fix or report.
c. Treat any SHA, count or status you remember as unverified until you have read it
   again.

## 3. Open PRs, every one, before other work

List **all** open PRs; do not rely on notifications. For each PR, in this order:

a. **Head:** the full head SHA now. Everything below is judged at this SHA.
b. **Merge state:** is there a conflict with the base?
c. **CI:** is `test-and-audit` green on this head? A result on an older head does not
   count.
d. **New since your last visit:** comments, review threads and checks. Read each one
   in full, including truncated notifications.
e. **Verdicts, and at which head:** Bob's NOTED or FLAGGED, and the automated
   review's verdict with its required fixes. **A verdict counts only at the current
   head.** After any push, including a merge of `main`, verify checks and verdicts for the new
   full head. Inspect existing requests first; request review once if none already
   covers that head. Do not duplicate an unanswered exact-head request or treat a
   stale acknowledgment as current approval.

Then act, in this priority:

1. a conflict or red CI on a PR you own;
2. anything addressed to you: a question, a required fix, a FLAGGED;
3. merges that are ready. The merge rule while Codex has no allowance
   ([quick reference](AGENT_HANDOFF.md#quick-reference-how-to-reach-each-agent-keep-this-current)):
   the verdict NOTED from Bob at the head, green `test-and-audit` at the head, and no
   unaddressed required fix. Use the merge method with the full head SHA. Codex
   reviews afterwards.

## 4. Sweep closed PRs and issues

(Claude, Codex desktop and the owner's Bob session.) List all PRs and issues, open or
closed, updated since your last sweep:

- a comment on a closed PR or issue is answered on the open PR concerned, or in a new
  PR, never in the closed thread;
- a "Bob task report ready" issue means a report branch waits for its PR. Open the PR
  with the index row, and let the merge close the issue.

## 5. Before you judge any change

For every review, and for every change of your own before you push:

Follow the [branch ownership and batching rules](AGENT_HANDOFF.md#branch-ownership-local-checks-and-review-batches).
Reviewers remain read-only; the named writer completes related fixes and local
preflight before one ready-for-review push. Record actual commands and limits;
failed or unavailable checks are not approvals.

a. **Read the whole diff** at the current head, and every file it changes. Read a test
   together with the input it builds, not only its assertions.
b. **Check it against what it claims:** the task file or PR description, and
   [the handbook](AGENT_HANDOFF.md). Check that it does nothing more.
c. **Recompute, don't trust.** Rerun counts, hashes and headline numbers with code:
   the project's tools first (such as `scripts/check_reports.py`), and an
   independent script where none exists.
d. **Trace the failure paths:** what happens when a step fails, an input is empty or
   missing, or it runs twice.
e. **One verdict, at the full head SHA,** with what you checked, what you could not
   check, and the evidence.

## 6. Where things stand

Read only what the steps above did not already show:

- [the handoff index](reviews/README.md): the newest rows at the top, including owner
  decisions;
- [the task index](tasks/README.md): Bob's tasks and their status;
- [`docs/BOB_PRACTICE.md`](BOB_PRACTICE.md): Bob's habits and the lessons log. Bob
  reads all of it; reviewers of Bob's work use it too;
- [the collaboration guide](AGENT_HANDOFF.md): roles, conventions, escalation.

## 7. Before you end your turn

- Every claim you make names the head SHA it was checked at.
- Every open item has an owner. A PR you are waiting on has a check-in scheduled (if
  your agent can schedule one) or is listed in your message to the owner.
- Anything the owner must decide is stated plainly, with the options.
- The named writer has committed and pushed the ready batch, or explicitly handed
  off the preserved worktree state and next action. Preserve unfinished work with a
  named owner; reviewers never commit or discard another writer's changes.
